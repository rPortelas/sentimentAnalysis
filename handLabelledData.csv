"For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood (judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face and large eyes like a frog.",Neutral,,,,
"The Fish–Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, ""For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet."" The Frog–Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, ""From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet."" Then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together.",Neutral,,,,
"When Alice next peeped out, the Fish–Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky. Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked.",Neutral,Fear,,,
"""There's no sort of use in knocking,"" said the Footman, ""and that for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you."" And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.
""How am I to get in?"" asked Alice.
""Are you to get in at all?"" said the Footman. ""That's the first question, you know.""",Neutral,,,,
"Alice opened the door and went in. The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other; the Duchess was sitting on a three–legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large caldron which seemed to be full of soup.",Neutral,,,,
"""There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!"" Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause.The only two creatures in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was grinning from ear to ear.
""Please would you tell me,"" said Alice, a little timidly, ""why your cat grins like that?""
""It's a Cheshire–Cat,"" said the Duchess, ""and that's why.""
""I didn't know that Cheshire–Cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats could grin,"" said Alice.
""You don't know much,"" said the Duchess, ""and that's a fact.""",Neutral,Fear,,,
"Just then the cook took the caldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the fire–irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them, even when they hit her, and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
""Oh, please mind what you're doing!"" cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror.
""Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!"" the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. ""I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,"" and she hurried out of the room.",Neutral,Anger,,,
"Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer–shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions. ""If I don't take this child away with me,"" thought Alice, ""they're sure to kill it in a day or two. Wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?"" She said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply. ""If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,"" said Alice, ""I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!""",Neutral,Anger,,,
"Alice was just beginning to think to herself, ""Now, what am I to do with this creature, when I get it home?"" when it grunted again so violently that Alice looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be no mistake about it—it was neither more nor less than a pig; so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood.",Neutral,Fear,,,
"Alice was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire–Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only grinned when it saw her. ""Cheshire–Puss,"" began Alice, rather timidly, ""would you please tell me which way I ought to go from here?""
""In that direction,"" the Cat said, waving the right paw 'round, ""lives a Hatter; and in that direction,"" waving the other paw, ""lives a March Hare. Visit either you like; they're both mad.""
""But I don't want to go among mad people,"" Alice remarked.
""Oh, you can't help that,"" said the Cat; ""we're all mad here. Do you play croquet with the Queen to–day?""
""I should like it very much,"" said Alice, ""but I haven't been invited yet.""
""You'll see me there,"" said the Cat, and vanished.",Fear,,,,
Alice had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare; it was so large a house that she did not like to go near till she had nibbled some more of the left–hand bit of mushroom.,Neutral,,,,

"The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it. ""No room! No room!"" they cried out when they saw Alice coming. ""There's plenty of room!"" said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm–chair at one end of the table.",Neutral,Anger,,,
"The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this, but all he said was ""Why is a raven like a writing–desk?""
""I'm glad they've begun asking riddles—I believe I can guess that,"" she added aloud.
""Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?"" said the March Hare.
""Exactly so,"" said Alice.
""Then you should say what you mean,"" the March Hare went on.
""I do,"" Alice hastily replied; ""at least—at least I mean what I say—that's the same thing, you know.""
""You might just as well say,"" added the Dormouse, which seemed to be talking in its sleep, ""that ""I breathe when I sleep"" is the same thing as ""I sleep when I breathe!"""" ""It is the same thing with you,"" said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its head impatiently and said, without opening its eyes, ""Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself."" ""Have you guessed the riddle yet?"" the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.
""No, I give it up,"" Alice replied. ""What's the answer?""
""I haven't the slightest idea,"" said the Hatter.
""Nor I,"" said the March Hare.",Neutral,Anger,,,
"Alice gave a weary sigh. ""I think you might do something better with the time,"" she said, ""than wasting it in asking riddles that have no answers.""
""Take some more tea,"" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
""I've had nothing yet,"" Alice replied in an offended tone, ""so I can't take more.""
""You mean you can't take less,"" said the Hatter; ""it's very easy to take more than nothing.""",Anger,,,,
"At this, Alice got up and walked off. The Dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice; the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the tea–pot.",Neutral,Anger,,,
"At any rate, I'll never go there again!"" said Alice, as she picked her way through the wood. ""It's the stupidest tea–party I ever was at in all my life!"" Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. ""That's very curious!"" she thought. ""I think I may as well go in at once."" And in she went.",Anger,,,,
"Once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table. Taking the little golden key, she unlocked the door that led into the garden. Then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high; then she walked down the little passage; and then—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower–beds and the cool fountains.",Neutral,Happiness,,,
"A large rose–tree stood near the entrance of the garden; the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red.

"Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began, in a low voice, ""Why, the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose–tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and, if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to—"" At this moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out, ""The Queen!

"First came ten soldiers carrying clubs, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognized the White Rabbit. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and last of all this grand procession came THE KING AND THE QUEEN OF HEARTS.",Neutral,,,,
"When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely, ""Who is this?"" She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.
""My name is Alice, so please Your Majesty,"" said Alice very politely; but she added to herself, ""Why, they're only a pack of cards, after all!""
""Can you play croquet?"" shouted the Queen. The question was evidently meant for Alice.
""Yes!"" said Alice loudly.
""Come on, then!"" roared the Queen.
""It's—it's a very fine day!"" said a timid voice to Alice. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.
""Very,"" said Alice. ""Where's the Duchess?""
""Hush! Hush!"" said the Rabbit. ""She's under sentence of execution.""
""What for?"" said Alice.
""She boxed the Queen's ears—"" the Rabbit began.
""Get to your places!"" shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other. However, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began.",Neutral,Fear,,,
"Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet–ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows. The croquet balls were live hedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to double themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.",Neutral,,,,
"The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time, the Queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting, ""Off with his head!"" or ""Off with her head!"" about once in a minute.
""They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here,"" thought Alice; ""the great wonder is that there's anyone left alive!""",Fear,Neutral,,,
"She was looking about for some way of escape, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air. ""It's the Cheshire–Cat,"" she said to herself; ""now I shall have somebody to talk to.""
""How are you getting on?"" said the Cat.
""I don't think they play at all fairly,"" Alice said, in a rather complaining tone; ""and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak—and they don't seem to have any rules in particular.""
""How do you like the Queen?"" said the Cat in a low voice.
""Not at all,"" said Alice.",Anger,Neutral,,,
"Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on. So she went off in search of her hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other; the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying, in a helpless sort of way, to fly up into a tree. She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again.",Neutral,,,,
"Just then Alice ran across the Duchess (who was now out of prison). She tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's and they walked off together.

""You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.""
""The game's going on rather better now,"" Alice said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.
""'Tis so,"" said the Duchess; ""and the moral of that is—""Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love that makes the world go 'round!""""
""Somebody said,"" Alice whispered, ""that it's done by everybody minding his own business!""

"""He took me for his housemaid!"" said Alice, as she ran off. ""How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!"" As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name ""W. RABBIT"" engraved upon it.

"""Mary Ann! Mary Ann!"" said the voice. ""Fetch me my gloves this moment!"" Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs.

"""That you won't!"" thought Alice; and after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air.

"There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then, and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air.

"I can't explain myself, I'm afraid, sir,"" said Alice, ""because I'm not myself, you see—being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing."" She drew herself up and said very gravely, ""I think you ought to tell me who you are, first.""",Anger,Neutral,,Chapter V,

The strain of using magic had brought beads of sweat to his forehead. He sighed and for a long time was content just to sit.

“I stopped the Urgals from catching you,” said Eragon, a pit forming in his stomach.
“Yes,” growled Brom, “but that piece of magic nearly killed you! You’ve been sleeping for two days. There were twelve Urgals.Twelve! But that didn’t stop you from trying to throw them all the way to Teirm, now did it? What were you thinking? Sending a rock through each of their heads would have been the smart thing to do. But no, you had to knock them unconscious so they could run away later. I’ve spent the last two days trying to track them down. Even with Saphira, three escaped!”

“It wasn’t a problem in Yazuac.”
“There was no choice then, and I couldn’t control the magic. This time it just seemed . . . extreme.”
“Extreme!” cried Brom. “It’s not extreme when they wouldn’t show you the same mercy. And why, oh why, did you show yourself to them?”
“You said that they had found Saphira’s footprints. It didn’t make any difference if they saw me,” said Eragon defensively.

This might even get back to the Empire!” He threw his hands up. “You don’t even deserve to be called a Rider after this,boy. ” Brom yanked his sword out of the ground and stomped to the fire.
